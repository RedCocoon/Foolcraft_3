# FoolCraft
FoolCraft 3 is a follow up to the original FoolCraft, it's for Minecraft 1.12.2, and is aimed at having as much fun as freakin' possible, while maintaining a progressive Minecraft experience. 

Mods like Vein-miner, Inventory Pets & Chance Cubes makes your play through light weight and fun, whilst FoolCraft offers depth by having heavy tech mods such as Ender IO and Thermal Expansion, as well as magical mods such as Botania. FoolCraft guarantees you to have a great time!

You can download and play the pack yourself using the Curse Launcher. [Curseforge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/foolcraft-3)
